### Hi there! I'm Michael Maaseide, a data science student at Northeastern University 

I have recently released my first iOS app - ChordCrack! I am currently working as a software engineer at NExT Consulting, and I'm learning a lot about development practices. I am always looking for more ways to keep learning and stay busy, so don't be afraid to reach out!<br>
